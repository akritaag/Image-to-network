Image-to-network
================

Read images and create networks out of them. Image source - pubmed

Proposed steps :-
1. [ ] read a .jpg file into the code and detect the text area. (check)
2. [ ] Isolate the text area and process the text into tesseract. (check)
  a. [ ] train tesseract for current data.
  b. [ ] test tesseract with the data.
  c. [ ] seek help from semantic concept of data. 
3. [ ]  Process the nodes and store them in a graph.
4. [ ] detect arrowheads - arrows(->) & inhibitors(-|) .
5. [ ] introduce links in graphs by detecting direction of arrows.
6. [ ] create GPML files.
7. [ ] process GPML files in s/w like cytoscape.
